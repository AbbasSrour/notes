## Attributes 
Attributes are properties used to describe an entity. Each attribute has a value set (or data type) associated with it – e.g. integer, string, sub-range, enumerated type, …
### Types of Attributes:
* **Simple:** Each entity has a single atomic value for the attribute.
* **Composite:** The attribute may be composed of several components.
* **Multi-valued:** An entity may have multiple values for that attribute.

**Note:**  In general, composite and multi-valued attributes may be nested arbitrarily to any number of 
levels, although this is rare. 

### Key Attributes
An attribute of an entity type for which each entity must have a unique value is called a key attribute of the entity type. A key attribute may be composite, and each key is underlined in the ER Diagram.
