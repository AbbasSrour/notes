# Domain Relational Calculus
A [[Formal Languages#Query Languages|non procedural]] [[Formal Languages#Pure Languages|query language]]  which equivalent in power to the tuple relational calculus, each query is an expression in the form:
$$\{\hspace{2mm}X_1,X_2,X_3...,X_n \hspace{2mm}|\hspace{2mm} P(X_1,X_2,X_3...X_n)\hspace{2mm}\}$$
Where $X_1,X_2,X_3...X_n$ represent the domain variables and $P$ represents a formula similar to that of the [[Tuple Relation Calculus|predicate calculus]].
