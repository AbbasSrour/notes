## ER Model
An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how [[Entities]]  such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a [[DBMS/Database/Database]]. The ER diagram is used as the conceptual schema of the [[DBMS/Database/Database]].

## Representation
In an ER diagram each component is represented in a distinct shape and connected together.
* **[[Entities|Entity Type:]]** is displayed in a rectangular box
* **Weak Entity Type:** Represented by a double rectangle.
* **[[Attributes|Attributes:]]** are displayed in ovals with each attribute connected to its entity type.
	*  Components of a composite attribute are connected to it.
	* Key attribute is underlined
	* Multi-valued attributes displayed in double ovals.
	* Derived attributes are represented with dashed ovals
* **[[Relationships|Relationship Type]]**   Diamond-shaped box is used to display a relationship type connected to the participating entity types via straight lines.
