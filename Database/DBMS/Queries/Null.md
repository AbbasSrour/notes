 # Null Values
 It is possible for tuples to have a null value, denoted by *null*, for some of their attributes; null signifies an unknown value or that a value doesn't exist. The result of an arithmetic expression null is null.

All aggregate operations expect *count*  ignore tuples with null values on the aggregated attributes.
