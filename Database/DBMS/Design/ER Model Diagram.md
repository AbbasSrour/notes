* **[[Entities|Entity Type:]]** is displayed in a rectangular box
* **Weak Entity Type:** Represented by a double rectangle.
* **[[Attributes|Attributes:]]** are displayed in ovals with each attribute connected to its entity type.
	*  Components of a composite attribute are connected to it.
	* Key attribute is underlined
	* Multi-valued attributes displayed in double ovals.
	* Derived attributes are represented with dashed ovals
* **[[Relationships|Relationship Type]]**   Diamond-shaped box is used to display a relationship type connected to the participating entity types via straight lines.
