## Telemetry

Collection of measurements or other data at remote points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment for monitoring.   

## OpenTelemetry

Is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics and logs. The goal of the project is to standardize and facilitate this task across different runtimes and languages.

OpenTelemetry is the result of merger between two standards in 2019 OpenTracing and OpenCencus.
