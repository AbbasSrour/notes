# Network Layers
## The Benefits Of Using A Layered Model
The benefits of using a layered model is  that it makes designing protocols easier, since each protocol can target only one part of the network, helps with competition between vendors since different protocols can work together, and prevents technology changes in one layer from affecting the other layers.

## The OSI Model
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is **a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system**. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.

OSI Layers:
-   **Application** - contains protocols used for process-to-process communications.
-   **Presentation** - provides for common representation of the data. 
-   **Session** - provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and to manage data exchange.
-   **[[Transport Layer]]** - defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data.
-   **[[Network Layer]]** - provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.
-   **[[Data Link Layer]]** - provides methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media.
-   **[[Physical Layer]]** - describes the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to transmit bits across physical connections.

## TCP/IP Model
The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. The current foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, as well as the User Datagram Protocol.
