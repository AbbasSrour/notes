## Bounding Functions
$g(n) = O(f(n))$ means that  $C \times f(n)$ is the upper bound complexity on $g(n)$, i.e. if there are positive constants $n_0$ and $c$  such that the right of $n_0$, which is the value of $g(n)$ always lies on or below $c \times f(n)$.

$g(n) = \Omega(f(n))$ means that  $C \times f(n)$ is the lower bound complexity on $g(n)$, i.e. if there are values $n_0$ and $c$ such that to the right of $n_0$, the value of $f(n)$ always lies on or above $c \times g(n)$.  

$g(n) = \Theta(f(n))$ means that  $C_1 \times f(n)$ is the upper bound complexity on $g(n)$ and 
$C_2 \times f(n)$ is the lower bound on $g(n)$.
