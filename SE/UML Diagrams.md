# Unified Modeling Language
UML or Unified Modeling Language is an open source standard for depicting and designing an OO system.

There are four main types of UML diagrams:
* **Use Case Diagram:**  A [[Use Case Diagram|use case diagram]] is a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system. A use case diagram shows various use cases and different types of users the system has and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses.
* **Class Diagram:**  [[Class Diagram|Class diagram]] in the Unified Modeling Language is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects.
* **Sequence Diagram:** The [[Sequence Diagram|sequence diagram]] *represents the flow of messages in the system and is also termed as an event diagram*. It helps in envisioning several dynamic scenarios. It portrays the communication between any two lifelines as a time-ordered sequence of events, such that these lifelines took part at the run time.
* **Statechart Diagram:**  [[Statechart Diagram|Statechart diagrams]] define different states of an object during its lifetime and these states are changed by events. Statechart diagrams are useful to model the reactive systems.
