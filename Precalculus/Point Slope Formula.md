## Point Slope Formula
The Point-Slope Formula is a way to write the equation of a line when you know its slope (m) and one specific point it passes through (x₁, y₁). 

The formula says that these two changes are equal, which is the fundamental idea behind a straight line!

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$ 
Where:
* $m$ is the slope of the line
* $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line
* $y - y₁$ represents the vertical change from a known point
